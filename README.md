# Stoichiometric

## Shortcomings and possible attacks

### Natural Logarithm function is not fully optimized
Due to a lack of time to make a implement the natural logarithm, the current cost for a `ln` call can be up to 5 XRD. 
Therefore, the current fee limit (10 XRD) does not allow to work with rates.
